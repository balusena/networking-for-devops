# Networking for DevOps

![Networking](https://github.com/balusena/ansible-for-devops/blob/main/networking.png)

Welcome to the **Networking for DevOps** repository! This resource provides a thorough introduction to essential networking
concepts crucial for DevOps professionals. 

Here, you will find detailed explanations of the **OSI Model**, including its seven layers and their functions, and the 
**TCP/IP model**, which simplifies networking concepts by combining some OSI layers. Dive into the differences between 
**TCP** and **UDP**, two key transport layer protocols with distinct use cases for security and speed.

Learn about **IP Subnetting** and **CIDR** for efficient IP address management, and understand **routing** for directing
network traffic effectively. The **DNS** section covers domain name resolution processes and DNS record types essential 
for translating domain names into IP addresses.

Explore HTTP protocols, including common **HTTP methods** and **response codes**, to understand web interactions. The 
repository also introduces various **network troubleshooting tools** like `ping`, `traceroute`, `curl`, and `nmap`, 
which are invaluable for diagnosing and resolving network issues.

Finally, the section **Putting the Toolbox Together** summarizes the key concepts and tools, helping you integrate this
knowledge into practical DevOps scenarios. This repository aims to enhance your networking skills and support effective 
network management in your DevOps practices.
