# Networking for DevOps

Understanding networking fundamentals is crucial for a successful career in DevOps. As a DevOps engineer, you'll need to
grasp the basics of the OSI model, which breaks down network communication into layers, helping you troubleshoot and optimize
network performance. Familiarity with TCP/IP protocols is essential, as these protocols form the backbone of most network
communications.

You'll also need to understand subnetting to calculate IP address ranges and subnet sizes accurately, which is vital for
efficient network design and management. Basic routing knowledge is necessary to manage and direct network traffic effectively,
ensuring data reaches its intended destination.

Additionally, proficiency with network debugging tools like Ping, Traceroute, and Telnet is important for diagnosing and
resolving connectivity issues. These tools help you identify where problems are occurring within the network and provide
insights into network performance.

Mastering these networking concepts and tools will enable you to build robust, scalable, and reliable systems, making you
a more effective DevOps engineer. This knowledge will not only improve your troubleshooting skills but also enhance your 
ability to design and maintain complex network infrastructures.

## 1. OSI Model
The Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model is a set of standards that defines how computers communicate over a network.
In the OSI model, data transmission is broken down into seven layers, each building upon the one before it. Every layer 
uses data from the previous layer and serves a specific purpose in the overall process of network communication.

The OSI model operates from the bottom up, starting with layer 1 (Physical) and ending with layer 7 (Application). The 
top layer is the point where users interact most directly with the network. For example, if youâ€™re reading this content 
on a device, you're engaging with the 7th layer right now.
